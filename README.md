# AutoSkypeTalk
This is a small applescript script that can be used to automagically send skype messages at a preset interval.


## Program Notes:
This software works by emulating keystrokes and so will not work if you click out of your skype window. This is due to their not being a skype API for Applescript (or anything [(Skype Api Retirement)] (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13081/Controlling-Skype-with-C) ). To activate functionallity that will return to skype and activate it please set activateSkypeOnKeypress to "Yes" through the series of dialougs that you are presented with upon running the app.
