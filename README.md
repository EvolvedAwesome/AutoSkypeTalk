# AutoSkypeTalk
This is a small applescript script that can be used to automagically send skype messages at a preset interval.


## Program Notes:
This software works by using the skype applescript api (decrepitated) to send message commands to skype. The advantage of using the api is that you can put skype in a the background as the messages are sent.
