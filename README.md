# AutoSkypeTalk
This is a small applescript script that can be used to automagically send skype messages at a preset interval.


## Program Notes:
This software works by emulating keystrokes and so will not work if you click out of your skype window. This is due to their not being a skype API for Applescript (or anything [(Skype Api Retirement)] (http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/13081/Controlling-Skype-with-C) ). I have provided an addition to the script that will activate skype on every run. This can be enabled by uncommenting the provided code (or writing your own :) ).
